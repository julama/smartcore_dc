//! # Collection of Distance Functions
//!
//! Many algorithms in machine learning require a measure of distance between data points. Distance metric (or metric) is a function that defines a distance between a pair of point elements of a set.
//! Formally, the distance can be any metric measure that is defined as \\( d(x, y) \geq 0\\) and follows three conditions:
//! 1. \\( d(x, y) = 0 \\) if and only \\( x = y \\), positive definiteness
//! 1. \\( d(x, y) = d(y, x) \\), symmetry
//! 1. \\( d(x, y) \leq d(x, z) + d(z, y) \\), subadditivity or triangle inequality
//!
//! for all \\(x, y, z \in Z \\)
//!
//! A good distance metric helps to improve the performance of classification, clustering and information retrieval algorithms significantly.
